We allow for 120 characters per line instead of the highly restrictive 80.

### Branching and Releases
#### Branches ####
New widgets should always be created in a separate branch from master. One or more widgets can be contained in a branch. A widget should only be merged with the Master branch if it has been tested is ready to be used with the current released version of Web AppBuilder - Developer Edition. 
#### Releases ####
Releases are created for the following reasons:
- A new version of Web App Builder has been released. The release is used to tag widgets compatible with that release
- A widget (or set of widgets) has been released
